# web__deployments-test

## Things which I would like to do if I have more time
### Backend
1. Unit/integration tests.
2. Mongoose models relationships.
3. Re-think tempalate model (separated model for template and verion maybe).

### Frontend
1. Unit/integration tests.
2. Better styling/rwd.
3. Double-check files structure / code spliting - maybe there are some things to improve.
